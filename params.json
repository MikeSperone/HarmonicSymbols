{"name":"Harmonicsymbols","tagline":"Audio software for my composition \"Harmonic Symbols\"","body":"### Harmonic Symbols\r\nThis software is to perform my composition \"Harmonic Symbols.\"  It detects all pitches in a sound and re-synthesizes them to the nearest equal-tempered pitch.  In the composition, it does this to a cymbal which does not have a regular overtone series, resulting in an interesting blend of sounds.  Different beaters, mallets, and sticks striking different areas on the cymbal results in different sounds being produced by the synthesis engine.\r\n\r\nThis may be used not only in my composition, but to create your own music as well.  You can use it as an audio effect.  Future versions will include a Max-For-Live device, and possibly a phone app as well.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact me at mike (at) mikesperone [dot] com to ask questions, send comments, or show me what music you've made with this!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
