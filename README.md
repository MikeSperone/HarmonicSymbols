Audio software for my composition "Harmonic Symbols"
This serves as the computer portion.

Harmonic Symbols

Harmonic Symbols is written for a large cymbal and a wide array of mallets, sticks, and beaters.
Contact the composer - Mike Sperone - for information on how to obtain the score.

A microphone is to be placed above the cymbal, placed in such a way in the room as to avoid feedback.  
The input gets sent into the computer by what ever means available (though a high quality audio interface is preferred).  This program receives the input, and returns a stereo output.  Please make any necessary adjustments in input and/or output volume.

Included in this github page are the Mac OSX application, and the source files as Max/MSP patches and accompanying files.  These source files will run on any computer (mac or pc) that can run Max/MSP or the freely available Max Runtime.  Feel free to contact me with regards to any issues.

This software is also free to use in any way you wish - for improvisations, new compositions, art installations, etc.  Please contact me as I'd love to know how you are using this.

Thank you.
